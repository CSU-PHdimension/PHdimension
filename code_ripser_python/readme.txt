This folder contains:
    (a) a rudimentary interface to ripser based on python
    (b) a collection of code to sample from some measures 
    (c) code for sampling specifically from Sierpinski arrowhead curves
    (d) the functions/scripts used to generate plots for the 
        figures related to the Sierpinski arrowhead curves.

Requires the following python packages:
    sklearn - used only for computing distance matrices
              (this library has a fast implementation)
    numpy - used throughout

Also uses Python packages which probably come by default with 
your python distribution:
    os
    subprocess
    multiprocessing
    re
    pickle

Please email me if any dependencies aren't listed here.
