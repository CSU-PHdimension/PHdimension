The code and figures in this folder are related to sampling points at random from various measures (uniform distribution on an interval, disk, square, triangle, unit cube, or according to the fractal measures on the Cantor set, Cantor dust, Sierpinski triangle, Cantor set cross interval, etc). There is also some functionality in this folder for computing persistence diagrams via Javaplex (http://appliedtopology.github.io/javaplex/).

This code was written by Henry Adams.
